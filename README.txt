Hello! In this readme I'll walk you through how to use my memtrace generating program, as well as how to generate memtraces like these on your own.

Getting the Memtraces:

For generating the memtraces, I will assume you are working on the pitt linux clusters

The memtraces required for this program are generated by the PIN pinatrace tool, so the PIN tool is required
This should be available to you in /usr/local/pin

From here, you will also need to utilize SPEC2017
This is offered in /afs/cs.pitt.edu/projects/spec-cpu2017

The pitt afs servers block certain file operations required when building the SPEC tools
So at the moment, all work done of the SPEC test suites must be done outside of the afs
You will likely need to ask stech@pitt.edu for a personal directory to be created in /home

To set SPEC2017 up for running, perform the following inputs:
cd /afs/cs.pitt.edu/projects/spec-cpu2017
./install.sh
You will then be prompted for an install directory, which should be:
/home/my_dir/spec

From here, cd into the spec directory. You will need to create a configuration file to run the SPEC test suites

cd /home/my_dir/spec/config
Your new config file needs to make a few changes to have everything ready to run, we will base ours off of Example-gcc-linux-x86
cp Example-gcc-linux-x86.cfg try1.cfg

You'll need to set the gcc directory to /.
You'll also need to remove the -fno-tree-loop-vectorize flag

From here, everything should be set up to build and run your SPEC test suites
For convenience, I've created a script, runpin.sh, that will iterate through each of the SPEC test suites, build them, run them with PIN, and then copy the memtrace files into a new directory
Copy this script into /spec/bin, and you should be able to run it from there.
Make sure to update the script to include the path to your Pin directory, as well as the target directory

Using memtraces to get reuse distance statistics:
Now that we have our memory traces, we're almost done. 

Simply copy all of the memtraces that you would like to generate statistics for into the memtraces directory
Then, run mem_reuse_stats.py in order to generate reuse distances across the memory trace file

It will automatically produce several graphs displaying statistics regarding the generated reuse distances

If you have any questions about setting up SPEC or working with python code provided, please feel free to reach out to me at tmd62@pitt.edu

Thanks!
